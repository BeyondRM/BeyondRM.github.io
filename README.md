BeyondRM is an open-source clone of the popular "RPG Maker" (VX Ace edition) game editor and engine, made by [Enterbrain](http://www.something.co.jp/ Enterbrain).

While the original 'rpg maker' is made in C++ with scripting in Ruby, we are taking the stance that an "RPG Maker" can be almost entirely made in Java, with similar scripting capabilities where necessary. BeyondRM is being developed in Java 8 for most modern features, with aspects of the editor being implemented with JavaFX-based FXML infrastructure, a lightweight application GUI component framework that is easily styled with CSS for beautiful appearance. It also may allow for powerful scripting to be done, with an interpreted language like [lua](http://lua.org/ Lua, a modern scripting language).
